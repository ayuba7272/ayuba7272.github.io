<h2 style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 1000px;">Measuring Effectiveness of Marketing</h2><br>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 1000px;">Customer loyalty is very essential to any business. In today's world of information overload, 
it is very difficult for any marketing communication to capture the attention of the customer.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 1000px;">The job of a marketing executive has become all the more complicated with the advent of technology. 
In addition to creating exciting content for the consumer to engage, the modern day marketer has to ensure that the communication reaches the attention of the consumer.
The channels of communication have also grown manifold with the advent of social media.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 1000px;"><mark><strong>Data Science</strong> can help the marketing team optimize their communication to deliver the <strong>right message</strong> 
to the <strong>right consumer</strong> through the <strong>right channel</strong> at the <strong>right time</strong> to win the attention and loyalty of the consumer.</mark></p>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 1000px;">Irrespective of the content, whether it is a discount offer or a product launch or you are just trying to win back a lost customer, 
the four facets of communication mentioned above are critical to drive the message home. Let's explore these a little more in detail:</p>
<ul>
	<li style="word-wrap: break-word;width: 900px;"><strong>The Right Customer : </strong>Identifying the right customer is the most important part of marketing. 
		Communicate the wrong message to the consumer and you will not only waste money on communication but also end up alienating the consumer to future communications. <br> 	
		<em>Over-communication</em> is one of the most common problems with many marketing teams today. With the availability of large marketing budgets, 
		marketing teams nowadays tend to communicate too frequently whether it is via E-mail or WhatsApp. This tends to reduce the interest of the consumer in the message that is being delivered.<br>
		Similarly, <em>under-communication</em> is also detrimental to the marketing effort, as customers rarely hear about your brand compared to others and hence we have lost the customers attention-span.
		<br>
		The ideal scenario would be to identify if the specific customer is eligible for the communication and further personalize the messaging to the customer, to get the most out of your marketing budget.</li>
